### GAME RULES

Game consist of board of tiles (grass, pavement and water), player (You) and bugs that represents enemies that player have to avoid in order to complete the game. 

Player can move one tile at a time - up, down, left and right (using arrow keys), but cannot go off screen. Bugs are moving with random speed that changes for each enemy - every time new bug appears on the left side of the board.

Your goal is to reach water tile without colliding with any of bug-enemies. Once your player collide with any enemy - game reset and player moves to starting position.

Once water is reached - game is won and You will be notified with short alert.
